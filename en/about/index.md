![about me](/images/avataaar2.png)

Big fan of open source; love to play novelty; jack of all trades, master of none; Work and Life balance; one of silent majority.

06/2018 finished my course of Bachelor's degree, 11/2019 finished my course of  Master's degree. In the college, I have learnt a lot of knowledge about electronic, electric and computer. Travelling and play novelty at accommodation during the whole my study life in terms of my character. After finishing studying, I think I have accumulated a lot of experience of new things. So I start to record all experience and questions and solutions.
